# PSReadlineHistory
The PSReadline module can maintain a persistent command-line history. However, there are no provisions for managing the file. This module attempts to fill that gap.

This module is available in the PSGallery, to install:

```powershell
PS> Install-Module -Name PSReadlineHistory
```
